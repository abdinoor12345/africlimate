🌿 AfriClimate
AfriClimate is a human-centered web platform built with Django and external APIs 
to empower farmers across Africa by combining climate-smart agriculture, AI-driven crop disease detection,
 and data-informed crop recommendations. The platform also includes a marketplace, an educational blog, 
 and plans to integrate a farmer-focused chatbot and blockchain certification for agri-products.


 🚀 Key Features
📍 Location-Based Crop Disease Detection
Farmers can input their location (e.g., "Mombasa"), and the system uses real-time weather
 and disease prediction data to alert them about potential crop diseases in their area.

🌱 Smart Crop Recommendations
The platform provides personalized crop recommendations based on the user's location and environmental conditions.
This feature helps farmers select the best crops to grow, improving yield and sustainability.

Based on location and environmental conditions, AfriClimate suggests optimal crops to grow, helping users improve yield and make better farming decisions.


🛒 Farmer Marketplace
A dedicated section where farmers can buy and sell tools, seeds,
 fertilizers, and harvests – connecting local communities and boosting local trade.

📰 Educational Blog
The blog features easy-to-read articles, tips, and guides on sustainable farming, 
climate adaptation, and success stories from real African farmers.

🔮 Coming Soon
🤖 Chatbot Assistant
A virtual farming assistant to answer questions, suggest best practices, and provide instant support in local languages.

🔗 Blockchain Certification
A system to verify and trace the origin of farming inputs like fertilizers, 
ensuring they are safe, certified, and eco-friendly.
